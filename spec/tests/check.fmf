summary: Specify additional checks which should be enabled by the test runner.

story: As a tester I want to enable additional checks when running my tests.

description: |
    In some cases we want to run additional checks while running a test. A nice
    example is a check for unexpected SELinux AVCs produced during the test,
    this can point to additional issues a user can run into and is very valuable
    for Red Hat based and Fedora distros.

    These checks can alter the test result and usually provide a separate log
    output. Note that the value set here can be overridden by L2 metadata.

    Currently the following additional checks are recognized:

    avc
        SELinux AVCs are inspected during the test time
    test-inspector
        Run test inspector

    By default no additional checks are run.

example: |
    check:
        - avc
        - test-inspector
